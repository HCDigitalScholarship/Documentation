How to add a tile to the Digital Scholarship grid gallery

Go to: http://library.haverford.edu/login and log in 

In the Dashboard, click on File Manager

Choose file and upload the image that you want to use for the tile.  You’ll see it display in the file manager.  
Click on the file and you’ll see an little gear and Properties. 
Under the file’s Properties there are several fields that are relevant to the grid

Title: This is the text that will display when users hover over the tile.
Description: This will appear underneath the title and should not be more than one or two sentences.
Tags:  These are the terms that Grid Gallery will  use for filter buttons.  Be sure to use existing terms and to spell them correctly or your tile won’t display.

Link: This is where you add the URL for your project.  

Next, go back to the File Manager and click on the image.  Instead of clicking on Properties, click on Sets.  You need to add the image to  “DS Services + Projects” for the image to appear in the gallery. 

Go back to the Dashboard and click on Grid Gallery.  There are three separate galleries on the site.  They all draw from the same set of files, but they have different filter buttons. 
	DS Projects is the gallery that appears on the main DS page. 
	DS Start Project appears on the Start Project page.
	DS Course Support appears on the Course Support page. 

If you click to edit one of the galleries, you’ll see the images and the order in which they will appear in the grid.  You can simply move them into a different order by dragging them into the desired order. 

As a general rule, DS projects is sorted with our most important projects on the top, followed by student work and people-related tiles.  
DS start project has a similar order.  However, DS Course support has student projects nearer to the top.

If you click on the grid tab, you can select which tags will display as filter buttons.  Green is selected, grey is unselected. 

The Grid Gallery add-on is relatively flexible and has many other options to explore.
